# Sentiment Analysis 

#### This is a practice repository having the notebook in which I have performed sentiment analysis on the IMDB Movies dataset.

The IMDB movie reviews dataset is present on Kaggle for free.

#### I have done all the necessary steps for the preprocessing of the dataset. 
#### Made two sets of the dataset one having the features of the Bag of Words and the other one having the features of the TD-IDF.
#### I have used logistic Regression, SVM and Multinomial Naive Bayes models on both the features datasets.
#### I have also printed the confusion matrices and the accuracy reports.
